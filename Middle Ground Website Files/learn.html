<h3>How It Works:</h3>

<p>Once the user inputs the two addresses, the program connects to the GoogleMaps Directions API to find the longitude and latitude of both addresses. These numbers are then averaged together to find the midpoint of the two addresses. One the midpoint of the longitude and latitude is found, Middle Ground uses the Google Places API to find a restaurant within 500 meters of the midpoint and returns the establishment's name, address, phone number, and hours of operation from the JSON data.</p>
