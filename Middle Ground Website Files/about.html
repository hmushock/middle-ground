<h3>Purpose:</h3>

<p>Imagine you have a couple free hours after work and you want to meet up with an old friend for snacks and maybe a few drinks. But where?</p>

<p>Any urban dweller knows that even traveling small distances through the bustling city can feel like it takes forever. That's why I created Middle Ground - a program that finds a restaurant closest to the midpoint between two addresses.</p>
<br>
<h3>Best Practices:</h3>

<p>As Middle Ground is still in a work in progress, there are a few best practices to keep in mind while using the program. Since the program returns a restaurant within 500 meters of the midpoint between two addresses, it is best suited for use in densely populated urban areas where it would be rare not to have a dining establishment within that distance of any address.</p>

<p>Middle Ground works best in densely populated areas, such as Philadelphia or New York and their surrounding suburbs. Locations in different cities separated by a long stretch of highway may not have a rest stop near the midpoint, though this issue has been partially resolved by automatically increasing the radius of the midpoint to 5000 meters if there is no establishment within 500 meters.</p>

<p>It is also critical that users are careful to type in the correct address before pressing Enter. There is not currently an option to edit the address if entered incorrectly and instead the program must be restarted. However, there are plans to add that function to Middle Ground in the near future.</p>
