<h3>Purpose:</h3>

<p>Imagine you have a couple free hours after work and you want to meet up with an old friend for snacks and maybe a few drinks. But where?</p>

<p>Any urban dweller knows that even traveling small distances through the bustling city can feel like it takes forever. That's why I created Middle Ground - a program that finds a restaurant closest to the midpoint between two addresses.</p>
<br>
<h3>Best Practices:</h3>

<p>As Middle Ground is still in the development and debugging stage, there are a few best practices to keep in mind while using the program. Since the program returns a restaurant within 500 meters of the midpoint between two addresses, it is best suited for use in densely populated urban areas where it would be rare not to have a dining establishment within that distance of any address.</p>

<p>Middle Ground also works best when both addresses are located in the same major city, since locations separated by a long stretch of highway may not have a rest stop near the midpoint. This could be remedied in the future by creating a separate setting for inter-city travel or making the radius for finding a midpoint establishment a percentage of the overall distance between the addresses.</p>

<p>It is also critical that users are careful to type in the correct address before pressing Enter. There is not currently an option to edit the address if entered incorrectly and instead the program must be restarted. However, there are plans to add that function to Middle Ground in the near future.</p>
