<h3>About the Creator</h3>

<p>My first brush with web development was as a young teenager learning basic HTML in order to make a simple fan site for my favorite musical artist at the time. While the site wasn't anything too complicated, the excitement I felt in creating something all my own stayed with me over the years and I always hoped to delve more deeply into the subject.</p>

<p>In January 2017, I took an Intro to Programming Concepts workshop with Girl Develop It on a whim, reigniting my interest in coding. Since then, I have dabbled in several front- and back-end languages, including HTML/CSS, Python, JavaScript, and SQL. My initial curiosity about development has become a full-fledged passion. I am looking forward to taking a Node.js workshop in March, while also continuing my self-guided learning.</p>

<p>When not tinkering with code, I enjoy going to BYO Wine Night at the PFS Roxy, playing board games (especially Resistance and Code Names), and trying new art classes at Fleisher (print making and lithography being two favorites!) I am an avid reader and am currently making my way through the <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> series in anticipation of the final season of Game of Thrones. I am always on the search for fun new Philadelphia restaurants to try - a major motivation behind the creation of Middle Ground.</p>
