<h3>More Options</h3>

<p>While Middle Ground currently only returns restaurants and dining establishments, I would like to add the possibility for users to search specifically for other types of establishments (such as movie theaters, museums, bars, coffee shops, etc.) This would create a more personalized experience for users, since they could tailor their results to their specific moods and interests, as well as make Middle Ground a more flexible program in general.</p>
<br>
<h3>Expanded Results:</h3>

<p>I also plan to improve Middle Ground by returning a list of establishments within an acceptable radius of the midpoint, rather than just the one location closest to midpoint. This would also allow users to balance overall distance with the desirability of the establishment to make the most informed choice about where they would like to meet. For example, users can decide it is worth one person walking a slightly longer distance to meet at a trendy new restaurant rather than going to a fast food place exactly at the midpoint.</p>
<br>
<h3>Ratings:</h3>

<p>Since Middle Ground may bring up restaurants that users are unfamiliar with, I would like to eventually to connect this program with the Yelp API. Ideally, I would like to bring up the Yelp ratings for all of the establishments returned on the results list or an option to view an establishment's Yelp page upon selection of a destination.</p>
